In this analysis of a school district's information, I was able to compare each school in that district using their students years and test scores, in addition to the school's budget, size, and type. In total, 15 schools were part of this analysis. I have created a number of comparisons including best/worst performance by overall passing, and average test scores broken down by student's years, school budget, size, and type. 

Based on the results from the analysis, we can see trends of charter schools having an overall higher rate of passing, as well as higher test scores than that of district schools. Along the same thought, I noted that the data also indicates that large-sized schools (2000-5000) have the worst test scores compared to medium (1000-2000) or small (<1000) sizes, and all district-classified schools are large. From this I would conclude that district schools have worse scores and passing rates than charter schools, but are also handling more students than charters. 

Additionally, based on the comparisons, I would not say there is a clear correlation between the amount of budget per studnet and overall passing or test scores. There is too wide a range in student performance in each spending range to confidently determine how budget would affect those outcomes. In fact, the data suggests that there is little to no connection at all.
